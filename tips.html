	<h1 class="panel panel-default">Weaponry</h1>
		<p>Don't think that knives are the only weapons in your kitchen. Every utensil, from ladle to fork and spatula to spork is a weapon. Consider everything in your drawers an arrow in your quiver. If MacGyver could turn a paper clip and a roll of paper towels into a Jet Ski, then you can use a slotted spoon to create a breakfast of mass destruction.</p>
	<h1 class="panel panel-default">Terminology</h1>
		<p>Peench: This is when you put a little bit of a spice between your fingers and throw it on your food. It's a lot like a pinch, except for the motherfucking fact that gangstas don't pinch. They peench.</p>
		<p>Dime Bag: This is a little bag that some people put some things into. I just use them to hold onto my spices. I fill every dime bag with one tablespoon of whatever spice is goin' in there. If I give you an exact measurement, it's because it's important to get it right, but most of the time, I just tell you to have a dime bag of salt and pepper handy to season to taste. In that case, just use a peench or two, until it tastes good on your tongue. Shaka!</p>
		<p>Nickel Bag: This is a half of a dime bag. You'll need about 1/2 tablespoon for recipes that call for these. By the way, these little bags are available at any good tobacco shop.</p>
		<p>Coagulate: This is a term I use instead of the word combine. It's just much more pimpish to let your flavors get together in a real intense way. Other chefs let their flavors combine, but when you and me get down in the kitchen, the flavors we make coagulate.</p>
		<p>Shaka-Zulu: This is something I say when something is about to taste better than your momma's nipples.</p>
