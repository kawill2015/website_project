						<p class="lead">First of all, get your oven all preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Place your chicken into a large bowl. It's time to get your chicken ready to receive the seasoning! Drop in your 20 sack of seasoned salt, followed by your dime bag of black pepper. Mix 1 cup brown ale with about 5 little drops of Thai hot sauce and pour it over your chicken. Bawk, bawk, motherfucka! Now drizzle in the balsamic vinegar and slap your chicken around the bowl. Toss in the garlic. Don't worry, it won't be all garlicky and shit. Drop in the chopped onion. Get your hands in there again, making sure to caress the chicken and get it covered up in those juices. Shaka! Liberally toss in a handful of jalapenos. Zulu! Pour in the cream of chicken soup. It's like gravy, baby. Get in there and mix it up one last time. Now before you go and chop up your bell peppers, make sure to remove those produce stickers. After that, place them inside with your chicken. Pour the chicken and the sauce into a large baking dish. Cook your chicken until it falls off the bone. In layman's terms, about 40 to 50 minutes. Bring your ass to the motherfuckin' table. It's time to eat some Finger-Lickin', Rib-Stickin', Fall-Off-the-Bone-and-into-Your-Mouth Chicken!</p>
